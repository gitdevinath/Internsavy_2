                        <li>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot glowing 
                            ball of hydrogen and helium – at the center of our solar system. It's 
                            about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it's our 
                            solar system's only star. Without the Sun's energy, life as we know it 
                            could not exist on our home planet.</li><br>
                        <li>The Sun is so large that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit 
                            inside it.</li><br>
                        <li>The Sun has an 11-year solar cycle during which the number of sunspots 
                            and solar activity varies.</li>
                        <li>Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are powerful eruptions on 
                            the Sun that can impact space weather on Earth.</li>

                <h3>How our Sun was formed</h3>
                <div class="content">
                    Physicists believe that the sun formed around 4.5 billion years ago when a 
                    cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula collapsed due to its own 
                    gravity. The cloud spun and flattened into a disk, with the sun forming 
                    at its center. The outskirts of the disk later became our solar system, 
                    including Earth and the other planets.<br><br>
                    The sun is made of atoms of gases such as hydrogen and helium. The
                    gas particles combined through the nuclear fusion process to form 
                    heavier elements and solar energy.<br>
                    Most of the nebula's material was pulled toward the center to form 
                    our Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of our solar system's mass.

                    <ul>
                        The time it takes to travel from Earth to the Sun depends on the 
                        spacecraft's speed and trajectory. The average distance from the 
                        Earth to the Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), 
                        and this distance is known as one astronomical unit (AU). The speed of 
                        light is about 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second).<br><br>

                            <h4>For reference:</h4>
                            
                        <li>Light takes approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.</li>
                        <li>If you were traveling at the speed of light, it would take about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach the Sun from Earth.</li><br><br>
                        However, spacecraft are not currently capable of reaching anywhere near the speed of light. The fastest spacecraft built by humans,
                        the Parker Solar Probe, was launched in 2018 to study the outer corona of the Sun. It will gradually get closer to the Sun over the 
                        course of several years. Even with its high speed, it takes the Parker Solar Probe several months to travel from Earth to its closest 
                        approach to the Sun.

                <h3>Temperature of the Sun</h3>
                <div class="content">
                    The Sun's temperature varies across different layers, with the 
                    core being exceptionally hot due to nuclear fusion reactions, 
                    while the outer layers have temperatures ranging from thousands 
                    to millions of degrees Celsius. 
                    <h4>Here's a brief overview:</h4>
                    <span>Core Temperature:</span> The core of the Sun is incredibly hot, 
                    with temperatures reaching about 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million 
                    degrees Fahrenheit). In the core, nuclear fusion reactions take place, 
                    primarily converting hydrogen into helium. These reactions release an 
                    enormous amount of energy in the form of light and heat.<br>
                    <span>Photosphere Temperature:</span> The photosphere is the visible 
                    surface of the Sun that emits light. It has an average temperature of 
                    around 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit). This is the 
                    temperature that is often referred to as the "surface temperature" of 
                    the Sun.<br>
                    <span>Corona Temperature:</span> The outermost layer of the Sun, called 
                    the corona, has temperatures ranging from about one to three million 
                    degrees Celsius. The high temperatures of the corona are still not 
                    completely understood, and it remains a topic of ongoing scientific 
                    research.

                <h3>How it affects us</h3>
                <div class="content">
                <span>Light and Heat:</span> The Sun's energy, in the form of light and heat, 
                is essential for life on Earth. It drives the processes of photosynthesis in 
                plants, providing the energy that sustains most life forms in the food 
                chain.<br>
                <span>Solar Radiation:</span> The Sun emits various forms of radiation, including 
                visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, and infrared (IR) radiation. While visible 
                light is essential for vision and plant growth, excessive exposure to UV radiation 
                can be harmful to living organisms. Earth's atmosphere provides a protective shield, 
                filtering out most of the harmful UV radiation.<br>
                <span>Solar Activity and Space Weather:</span> The Sun's activity, such as solar flares 
                and coronal mass ejections, can influence space weather. Solar storms can impact Earth's 
                magnetic field and cause disruptions in satellite communications, power grids, and other 
                technological systems.<br>
                <span>Climate and Weather:</span> The Sun plays a crucial role in Earth's climate 
                and weather patterns. The differential heating of the Earth's surface by the Sun drives 
                atmospheric circulation, leading to the creation of weather systems, wind patterns, 
                and ocean currents.<br><br>
                It's important to note that while the Sun's energy is essential for life on Earth, proper precautions should be taken to avoid overexposure to UV radiation, as it can lead to sunburn, skin damage, and an increased risk of skin cancer. Using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and limiting sun exposure during peak hours are common measures to mitigate these risks.

                <h3>How/When will the Sun ends</h3>
                <div class="content">
                    The eventual fate of the Sun is a well-studied topic in astrophysics. 
                    Here's a general overview of the Sun's life cycle and how it will end:<br><br>
                    <span>Current Stage (Main Sequence):</span> The Sun is currently in the main 
                    sequence phase of its life cycle, where it fuses hydrogen into helium in its core. 
                    This process has been ongoing for about 4.6 billion years and is expected to continue 
                    for another approximately 5 billion years.<br>
                    <span>Red Giant Phase:</span> As the Sun exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will expand 
                    into a red giant. This phase is expected to occur in about 5 billion years. During 
                    this expansion, the outer layers of the Sun will extend outward, possibly reaching the 
                    orbits of Mercury, Venus, and even Earth. The Sun will become much larger but less dense.<br>
                    <span>Helium Fusion:</span> In the core of the red giant, helium fusion will begin, 
                    creating heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. The outer layers of the Sun will be 
                    expelled into space, forming a shell of ionized gas known as a planetary nebula.<br>
                    <span>Planetary Nebula and White Dwarf:</span> The expelled outer layers will eventually 
                    dissipate, leaving behind a hot, dense core called a white dwarf. The white dwarf is the 
                    remnant of the Sun's core, composed mainly of carbon and oxygen. This white dwarf will 
                    gradually cool over billions of years, becoming a "black dwarf."
